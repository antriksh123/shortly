## Description
Shortly is a URL-shortening service developed using Python and Flask frameworks. It allows you to shorten long URLs into compact and shareable links. With Shortly, you can easily create shorter and more manageable URLs for sharing on social media platforms, email, or any other medium.

## How to Run the Project
To run the project, follow these steps:

## Tech Stack Used
Shortly is built using the following technologies:

- Python: A powerful programming language used for backend development.
- Flask: A lightweight web framework for Python.
- Bootstrap 5: A popular CSS framework for building responsive and stylish web interfaces.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for customizing the application's appearance.
- SQLite: A lightweight and embedded database used for storing URL and statistics data.
